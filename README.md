# Cisco First Hop Redundancy Troubleshooting Lab 1

## Trouble Ticket #1

### Problem
- Your system administrator reports that when the link between R2 and R4 goes down, traffic from Host 1 is still attempting to use R2 as the default gateway.

### Desired outcome
- Configure the network so that when the link between R2 and R4 goes down that all traffic goes directly through R3.

## Trouble Ticket #2

### Problem
- Your system administrator has also brought to your attention that when the link between R2 and R4 is restored, that Host1 is still using R3 as the default gateway.

### Desired outcome
- Configure the network so that when the link between R2 and R4 is up, that all traffic goes through R2.
